# iso-elk-stack
The UCLA Information Security Office customized an integration of Logstash, Elasticsearch, and Kibana (the "ELK stack") to extract security-specific information, richly visualize that data, and create notifications based on specific concerns.

Note:
For installation instructions for both the central ELK server and client servers (that use log-courier to ship events to the central ELK server), please visit the following link and select the "Install" tab: https://www.itsecurity.ucla.edu/elk
